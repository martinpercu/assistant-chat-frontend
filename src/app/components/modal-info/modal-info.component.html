          🔍 A Shared Knowledge Base, But Specialized Agents
        </div>
        <div class="text-left text-xs">

          All agents use the same vector database built from PDF documents, but each is configured to respond only within their specific area—Napoleon, U.S. presidents, or Lisa. This keeps responses focused and relevant. You can access the original documents anytime via the "Docs" link.

          💾 Independent Chat Memory (if login)
        </div>
        <div class="text-left text-xs">
          Each agent keeps its own chat history, remembering only what you share with them. For example, you could tell one agent your name is Peter and another that it's Mary, and each will remember it only in their own conversation.
